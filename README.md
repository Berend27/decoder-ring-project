# decoder-ring-project

This project is a decoder and encoder for three different encoding methods, the Caesar cipher, the Polybius square, and the substituion cipher.
It was done to practice unit testing and JavaScript syntax.

JavaScript was used for the programming, and the libraries Mocha and Chai were used to write unit tests in an efficient manner.

As of October 2021, there are no future plans for this project.
